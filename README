This is CL-TUPLES, an experimental "type facade" which appears to give you configurable homogenous
vectors based on defstruct, and allow for free conversion between multiple values and vectors. As
such it is to be hoped that it will be of most use when writing code for raytracers, games, and
the like, which use simple linear algebra primitives intensely.

The rule is that if a symbol ends in an asterisk the function or macro bound to it will operate
on or return multiple values, and the unadorned symbols will work with vectors.
